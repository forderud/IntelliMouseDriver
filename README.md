Filter drivers for Microsoft Pro IntelliMouse that implements safety checks and exposes WMI interfaces. Based on the KMDF HID device [firefly](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/tree/main/hid/firefly) sample from Microsoft that have been updated to work with more recent IntelliMouse models ([backport request](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-driver-samples/issues/1022)). The mouse should report itself with `VendorID=045E` (Microsoft) and `ProductID=082A` (Pro IntelliMouse).

### Driver projects
| Driver      | Description                                             | Test utilities |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **MouseMirror** | An upper device filter driver for the Mouse class for Microsoft Pro Intellimouse. Registers a [MouseMirrorDeviceInformation](MouseMirror/MouseMirror.mof) WMI class that can be accessed from user mode to mirror mouse movement. Can easily be modified to also work with other mouse models. | `MouseMirror.ps1`: PowerShell script for enabling mirroring of mouse movement through the WMI interface. |
| **TailLight** | An upper device filter driver for the HID class for Microsoft Pro Intellimouse. Registers a [TailLightDeviceInformation](TailLight/TailLight.mof) WMI class that can be accessed from user mode to control the tail-light. | `TailLight.ps1`: PowerShell script for updating the tail-light through the WMI interface. |
|               |                    | `HidUtil`: Command-line utility for querying and communicating with HID devices. |
|               |                    | `flicker`: Application for causing the mouse to blink by sending commands through the WMI interface. |
| **VirtualMouse** | [UDE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/usbcon/developing-windows-drivers-for-emulated-usb-host-controllers-and-devices) driver for emulating a USB mouse. Based on [xxandy/USB_UDE_Sample](https://github.com/xxandy/USB_UDE_Sample) | `MouseMove`: Command-line utility for moving the mouse cursor. Does unfortunately _not_ work in a VM. |

### Prerequisites
* Optional: Microsoft [Pro IntelliMouse](https://www.microsoft.com/en/accessories/products/mice/microsoft-pro-intellimouse) for testing of the `TailLight` driver.
* Separate computer for driver testing. Needed to avoid crashing or corrupting your main computer in case of driver problems.
* USB 3 A/A crossover cable or network connection for for kernel debugging.

**Getting started information for [driver testing](../../wiki/Driver-testing)**.
